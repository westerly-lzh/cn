## Knowledge Sharing: Context, Confusion and Controversy

### Context

> We can also deduce from this systemised view of knowledge and context that any analysis of an organisation’s processes and practices must be executed in full awareness of the context within which the practice is embedded [44,49].

> History will have played a part in shaping and developing both context and process and will be carried forward in the human consciousness [49]. Therefore, an insight into the historical events that have shaped both context and process will reveal a better understanding of the current process and practices.

### Conclusion

This paper has addressed the challenges of knowledge sharing across business sectors. Many of the existing assumptions concerning the nature of knowledge and the extent to which it can be codified have been challenged. Knowledge is not a commodity that can easily be captured and transferred across contexts.Any approach at knowledge sharing must be predicated on engaging the individual.Knowledge is frequently embedded in context such that an understanding of the ‘host’ and ‘receiving’ contexts becomes central to any knowledge-sharing endeavour.

## KnowledgeScope: Managing Knowledge in Context

### Knowledge and Context

> Without contextual information, workers cannot fully understand the rationale nor trust the source of the knowledge and therefore decide not to adopt it [3,40]

> Watts [40] found that management consultants are more likely to adopt advice provided by a colleague if the credibility of the source can be determined from the contextual information included in the email. Tyre and von Hippel [38] found that learning occurs through people interacting in context. They believed that each setting presents a particular mix of resources (such as people, tools, and events) that can be used to help solve a problem, and the way in which such resources are used will vary with the particular setting.

> Context may mean different information for participants playing different roles in an organizational process. Within a functional group such as human resource managers, or across roles within a process such as the sales clerks, order clerks, warehouse clerks, supervisors, and customers in an order fulfill- ment process, communities of practice may develop [8,42], each having its own shared frame of refer- ence—a shared understanding of events and ideas, a shared vocabulary and shared knowledge [9,11,44]. Each community looks at a process from a different perspective, has different knowledge requirements and therefore defines context by their own interest in the process

###Conclusion

Knowledge must be stored with context in which it is created and used. A knowledge management system that addresses two main causes of non-use: the lack of a standard, context-rich knowledge structure accepted by different types of users, and the documentation burden. This system organizes knowledge around the organizational processes in which the knowledge is created, captured, and used


## A Context-based Model for Knowledge Management Embodied in Work Processes

### Context,Work Process

> Work process context is dynamic: new events appear and new decisions are made, modifying process flow. For actions and events to be understood fully, all relevant contextual information involved in those circumstances should be available to stakeholders [6,24,32,33].

----

> Organizations that do not associate contextual knowledge with activities and the devices produced by them have huge sets of documents with little or no connection among them [14]. Because the organizational memory does not acquire associated context to relate meaning and reasoning to their content, they are often useless as a source of information. As a result, no conditions are formed for reusing content produced in previous situations

----

> Context has become increasingly important in recent years in several areas. According to Brézillon [9] ‘‘context is a set of information used to characterize a situation in which human and computational agents interact”. When context is about communication among people, it represents the history of events occurring during a period of time, the general knowledge state of agents and a small set of expectations at that moment. Brézillon [8] also states that context constrains problem solving without intervening in it. Schmidt [34] defines context awareness as knowledge about user and device states, including surroundings, situation, and, to a lesser extent, location. 

----

> Many proposals for capturing tacit knowledge consider contextual knowledge and try to integrate different forms and
types of contexts. Te’eni and Weinberger [37] report a survey relating knowledge and context to development of organiza- tional memory architecture (OMA). According to them, all OMA must be able to represent knowledge, context (meta-knowl- edge) and context use. Borges et al. [7] illustrate the use of contextual information in decision making and implementation. Ochoa et al. use context to support group decision making in disasters [28]. 


### Conclusion

The goal of this paper is to present a model for managing context-based knowledge, which addresses the creation, storage, and reuse of contextual knowledge, encompassing the representation, capture, storing, comparison, and presentation of knowledge in the setting where the work process activity is performed. This Knowledge Management model aims to estab- lish organizational memory, including the results of performing the work process activity and the context through which the results were produced.Wealso discuss specifically mechanisms that can be used to capture this information within the cycle of categorizing and using knowledge
